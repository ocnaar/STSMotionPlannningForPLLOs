# Motion planning for the sit-to-stand movement of Powered Lower Limb Orthoses (PLLOs)
The motion planning strategy relies on a transformation that maps the desired trajectory for the Center of Mass (CoM) of the system into reference trajectories in the space of the angular positions of the links of a three-link planar robot. The resulting sit-to-stand movement is illustrated with the implementation of a tracking controller based on feedback 
linearization, and control allocation.
